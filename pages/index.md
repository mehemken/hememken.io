title: About me
date: 2017-3-30
lead: I write computer programs in python and build stuff on AWS.

##This site is under construction

I'll be adding a few things in the near future:

* A little bit about myself
* PDF downloadable resume
* Pictures

I will initially have just two pages on this site: the home page and the resume page. The home page will feature some introductory blurb, some picture and links to GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. The resume page will have a downloadable resume. Perhaps I'll name the home page "About me" and the resume page "Resume". Maybe eventually I'll add a blog.

It's been about a week and a half since I created these pages. Since I've done that, I've set up a server, messed with Nginx some as well as Jenkins. Now this site will be automatically updated when I push this to GitHub. (9 Apr 2017).

Perhaps I'll need a blog here. I can definitely make it a static site blog. The longer it gets the longer it will take to py

##Contact me

The best way to contact me right now is on Twitter, my handle is [@mehemken](http://twitter.com). Send me a direct message. If we get along there I'll give you my email. Job offers are welcome. Especially if they are in the DevOps/Cloud category or they involve Linux and python.

##View my code

I have some code up on GitHub. Some of the stuff there, I'm proud of, but other stuff is just there because I needed to access it from multiple laptops. I have to upload one project in particular.

##Pictures

I'll be adding a few pictures of myself so you'll be able to recognize me if
you see me. I do some Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and I have some action shots.
