##About

I'm a junior automation engineer in Los Angeles, CA. I'm working on getting the [AWS Solutions Architect Associate][3] and I should have that in a few months.

I work mostly with Python, which I've been using for a couple of years for personal projects. Currently, I'm using AWS for a few personal services that I've written in the Flask. Those are served up with Nginx and my CI/CD is powered by Jenkins. Although, I'm looking to switch to Buildbot because of my Python background. Jenkins runs on the JVM and my projects do not. For that reason I think Jenkins is not the right tool for this job.

In my spare time I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, follow the world chess elite tournaments and eat sushi in West Los Angeles.

##Hire me

Does your team manually deploy code to production? Are you manually running your tests? Do you manually set up a staging environment? Would you run your tests more often if they were automated?

You don't have to live with these pain points. All of this can be automated with well known, well documented, open source tools. I can help you set up a continuous pipeline tailored to your specific needs.

I'm actively looking for full, part time or contract work that involves AWS, CI/CD and Python. If you already use other technologies such as Chef, golang, docker etc, I would be very excited to work with those tools as well!

One example of my work is the [International JiuJitsu Education Fund][5] website. The infrastructure is all on AWS.

##What I do

* Cloud infrastructure with CloudFormation or Terraform
* Configuration management with Ansible
* CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins or Buildbot
* Software engineering with Python
* Configure your webserver with Nginx

## Cloud Ops 101 Meetup

I am host and founder of the [Cloud Ops 101][4] meetup under the Learn Teach Code group in Los Angeles. The purpose is to gather folks who are studying for the AWS certifications tests and to learn about effective tools to work in the cloud. You can visit the latest iteration of it on the [Learn Teach Code LA][4] website. Look for CloudOps 101 hosted by Marco H.
