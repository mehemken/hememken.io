lead: I write computer programs in python and build stuff on AWS.

##About

I'm a developer and operations engineer in Los Angeles, CA. My [AWS SysOps Admin - Associate][3] Certification is in progress.

Most of my code is done with Python, with which I've written several programs and tools that automate git, docker, vim, tmux, and firefox. I currently use AWS for a few personal services that I've written in the Flask. Those are served up with Nginx and my CI/CD is powered by Jenkins. In my spare time I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

##Hire me

I'm actively looking for full time or part time work that involves Python, Linux and/or AWS. If you use other technologies such as Chef, golang, docker etc, I am very excited to learn on the job! To see some of my work, visit the [International JiuJitsu Education Fund][5] website. If you'd like to contact me, please do so at mehemken@gmail.

##What I do

* Cloud infrastructure (on AWS)
* Configure your webserver (with Nginx)
* CI/CD pipeline (with Jenkins)
* Lightweight user interface (with Python/Flask)

##AWS Meetup

I also host a fortnightly meetup dedicated to studying for the AWS Certification exams. You can visit the latest iteration of it on the [Learn Teach Code LA][4] website. Look for CloudOps 101 hosted by Marco H.
