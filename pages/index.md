lead: I write computer programs in python and build infrastructure with Terraform and Ansible.

##About

I'm a junior automation engineer in Los Angeles, CA. I'm working on getting the [AWS Solutions Architect Associate][3] this year.

I work mostly with Python, which I've been using for a couple of years for personal projects. Currently, my interests lie in automating code deployment to the cloud. Most of my projects are built with Flask, however I've got a few projects going in Django and Go that I'll automate as well. My main tools for automation are Terraform and Ansible.

I've been quite dissatisfied with Jenkins and Buildbot as CI/CD tools. They are too complicated to use for simple things like single page websites. I'm intersted in exploring the CI/CD space to find simpler tooling and methods and perhaps build my own FOSS solutions.

In my spare time I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, follow the world chess elite tournaments and eat sushi in West Los Angeles.

##Hire me

## Cloud Ops 101 Meetup

I am host and founder of the [Cloud Ops 101][4] meetup under the Learn Teach Code group in Los Angeles. The purpose is to gather folks who are studying for the AWS certifications tests and to learn about effective tools to work in the cloud. You can visit the latest iteration of it on the [Learn Teach Code LA][4] website. Look for CloudOps 101 hosted by Marco H.
