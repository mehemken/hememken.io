lead: I write computer programs in python and build stuff on AWS.

##About

I'm a developer and operations engineer in Los Angeles, CA. Most of my code is done with Python, with which I've written several programs and tools that automate git, docker, vim, tmux, and firefox. I currently use AWS for a few personal services that I've written in the Flask. Those are served up with Nginx and my CI/CD is powered by Jenkins. In my spare time I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

##Work

If you'd like to hire me on a contract basis, please send me an email. I'm on Gmail using the same handle I use on this site. I actively pursue freelance projects as my time permits. My most recent project was setting up a Wordpress installation for a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu academy in Los Angeles. If you are not in Los Angeles, but would like to hire me, I am open to working remotely.
