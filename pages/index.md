lead: I do Data Science in Python and build on the cloud with Terraform and Ansible.

##About

I am currently doing Data Science at UCLA External Affairs. This is the department that is responsible for the university's private fundraising. We are the top public school at fundraising in the nation. Last year we raised $650 million in private funds.

I work mostly with Python, which I've been using for a couple of years for personal projects. Currently, my interests lie in automating code deployment to the cloud. In my spare time I've learned to use Ansible, Terraform, CloudFormation and various Python libraries. I've also played around with various languages such as Rust, Go and JavaScript.

My career prospects look to be moving toward Data Science. Recently I've been working a lot with Jupyter Notebooks (see my [Stats Sesh][8] repo on GitHub). After a long time I've been finally able to use Python at my day job. It's been a long time coming but my current boss seems to be excited about it.

In the near future I'll be doing some formal statistical analysis and in a bit more distant future I'm hoping to do some real machine learning projects. One book that I've only started but already highly recommend is [Aurélien Géron][9]'s book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow*.


##Hire me

If you'd like to learn Python or the command line (Linux/OSX) I'm happy to tutor at ~$40/hr, negotiable.

If you think I'd be a good fit for your project, let me know! I'm happy to work on side projects and I'll entertain full time Data Science positions at $85k/annually and above.

##What I do

* Data Science with Python  
* Cloud infrastructure with CloudFormation or Terraform  
* Configuration management with Ansible  
* Software engineering with Python  
* Configure your webserver with Nginx
