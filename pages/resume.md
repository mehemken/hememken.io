##Work

If you'd like to hire me on a contract basis, please send me an email. I'm on Gmail using the same handle I use on this site. I actively pursue freelance projects as my time permits. My most recent project was setting up a Wordpress installation for a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu academy in Los Angeles. If you are not in Los Angeles, but would like to hire me, I am open to working remotely.
